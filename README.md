# WordScramble

## Description
This is another simple SwiftUI game: WordScramble. THe app gives you a 8 letter word and the user tries to make as many words as possible with it.
You can only use real words and they must be larger than 2 words.

## UseMe
Look at the 8-lettered word on the top section. Click on the Text field in the section below the word,
which says "enter your word." Hit enter when you are done.

If it is valid and unique, it will be added to the "Used Word" list on the bottom section.
Otherwise, the user will be alerted why their inputted word does not work.
If it worked, your point count will go up as well.

Hit "Start new Game!" on top if you are done with the current word or want to try a new one. 
This will give you a new word to try to scramble, and restart the score.

## New Used Features
(In no particular order)

List; autocapitalization toggles; onSubmit; onAppear; guard; Bundle (grabs URL of file); String trimming
Strings contentsOf (grabs urls contents); fatalError; UITextChecker (first Objective C library); NS Range.
